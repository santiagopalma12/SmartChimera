MISSION PROFILE WEIGHTS JUSTIFICATION

METHOD: Theoretical optimization based on mission objectives

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
1. Resilient profiles (mantenimiento): High redundancy + BC penalty
2. Performance profiles (innovacion): High skill depth + no BC penalty
3. Speed profiles (entrega_rapida): High collaboration + availability

MANTENIMIENTO (Resilient):
- redundancy=5.0: Ensures multiple people per critical skill
- bc_penalty=20.0: Strongly avoids linchpins (Bus Factor protection)

INNOVACION (Performance):
- skill_depth=10.0: Prioritizes Level 5 experts over generalists
- bc_penalty=-5.0: BONUS for linchpins (accepts the risk)

ENTREGA_RAPIDA (Speed):
- collaboration=10.0: Maximizes pre-existing team synergy
- availability=4.0: Requires immediate resource availability

CITATION FOR PAPER:
"Mission profile weights were designed following established software 
engineering principles: resilient configurations maximize redundancy 
and penalize single points of failure (BF protection), while 
performance configurations prioritize technical depth over Bus Factor 
concerns (Lappas 2009, Dave 2018)."
